Been an amazing week, highs and lows, but I have really enjoyed it.

I had moments where I felt almost lost, but then I found a new category that simply clicked.

I have/will include more notes in my README.md file in terms of assignment reflection.

I have a significant number of changes to ensure I have met the assessment criteria. e.gÂ position: absolute and flexbox

One challenge I came across was I was thought we were trying to create something similar to the spacey website however some of the instructions on here seems to conflict in consistancy for example I added my images into the HTML as I wanted them to scroll rather than setting the background image on the CSS, so I wasn't sure if I misunderstood.
